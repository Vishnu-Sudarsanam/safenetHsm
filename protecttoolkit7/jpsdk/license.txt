All rights not expressly granted by this License are reserved to Thales or its licensors. Thales grants no express or implied right under Thales or its licensors' patents, copyrights, trademarks or other Thales or its licensors' intellectual property rights. Any supplemental software code, documentation or supporting materials provided to you as part of support services provided by Thales for the Software (if any) shall be considered part of the Software and subject to the terms and conditions of this License.
